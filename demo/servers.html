        <p>The recommended way to work with PushStateTree is by using a server that support PushState.</p>
        <p>
          Any server that you can rewrite the request URI will allow you to add support to PushState, but to know how to do
          that, you need to understand what is push state, a quick overview about the feature is that you can instead use
          hash (#) symbol to navigate, you can change the location url without reloading the page. But, that means when the
          user try to refresh the page, the server needs to start delivery the content from the URL you are, and if the server
          try to find a file in that path of the server and it doesn't exist, the page will fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very common implementation of Push State is try to check in the backend if the file that is being required exist,
          if isn't found, the server needs to return the <i>index.html</i>, and if the file exists, it should return the
          actual file.
        </p>
        <p>
          By doing that, if you enter the URI <i>/app/section/id</i> you actually are downloading the <i>/index.html</i>
          and your <b>PushStateTree</b> will trigger the sequence of events to load your "app", "section" and data from the
          "id" however your server doesn't need to fill your <i>index.html</i> with any of that data, witch also means it can
          be a static file, and the data needed can be requested by XHR.
        </p>
        <p>
          How about the SEO? I will cover that in other part, keep in mind that currently most of the search engines read
          dynamic content generated by javascript, but nowadays they don't do XHR and Web Socket requests. No worries, there
          are many ways to solve that problem.

          My Server doesn't support PushState...
          <a href="pushState-not-supported" class="anchorjs-link"><span class="anchorjs-icon"></span></a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Oh no... Don't let that stop you, disable the <i>pushState</i> support in the <b>PushStateTree</b> and it still
          will work, like this page, if you are accessing by the <i>http://gartz.github.io/pushStateTree</i> address, it
          auto-disabled the pushState feature, but if you are running this demo from your local environment by using
          <code>npm start</code> and the url <i>http://localhost:3000/</i> it will only disable in case your browser doesn't
          support it.

          I will show some example of PushState server configurations you can do, you can do this configuration in any level
          and almost any programming language that works with serving HTML, because of that I will try to focus on some of the
          most used servers in the web, but if you are using another and don't know how to do, please open a issue and I will
          try to help you by updating this page, or if you do know but is not here, let's help our folks by doing a pull
          request of your example :)

        </h2>
        <p>
          To work with Apache 2 it's possible to write in the website configuration or in the <i>.htacess</i> file, if
          that isn't working make sure that <b>AllowOverride all</b> is configured in the <b>directory</b> option to able
          to use ModRewrite. As the result, all files that are required in your backend but doesn't exist will be
          redirected to the <i>index.html</i> file.
